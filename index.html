            Welcome to the Cursed Gems Dev Blog! This is where I will be posting monthly updates(or attempting to at least) on the progress of Cursed Gems or any other of my current projects. If you're here I'm assuming you must've played Act 1, and if so thank you so much! And if you didn't, well it's time to go take that next step and click that download button and play! Nah, in all seriousness thank you so much for the support, whether you've played or not. You even being on this blog site means you've shown interest in my game, and all interest is good! Well now that I've got you all here, I get to completely nerd out about my own game!
