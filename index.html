            Welcome to the Cursed Gems Dev Blog! This is where I will be posting monthly... bi-monthly... semi-... ehh, let's just say consistent updates for now on the progress of Cursed Gems or any other of my current projects. If you're here I'm assuming you must've played Act 1, and if so thank you so much! And if you didn't, well it's time to go take that next step and click that download button and play! Nah, in all seriousness thank you so much for the support, whether you've played or not. You even being on this blog site means you've shown interest in my game, and all interest is good! Well now that I've got you all here, I get to completely nerd out about my own game!

            It was a long path before I could finally get this project off the ground. At first it was nothing but an idea I had in my head since I was in high school, I had no idea where to even start when developing a game. Then it hit me! "If I don't know how to make a game, I'll just make something else! Why don't I just make Cursed Gems a webtoon! God, that's just a genius idea, why haven't I thought of this sooner!", young Pazmaz exclaimed, eyes filled with glee. Yes, I was convinced that this was my ultimate path to success. However, there was one small problem with this full proof plan. I had no idea how to make a webcomic, or how to draw, or how to format panels, or do basically anything that any webtoon creator worth their salt would know. I didn't let that stop me! I was already committed to the idea. There's no turning back now! I've read manga, that was good enough right? (Spoiler alert: No, it was not good enough). To make a long story, actually no that's a lie, it was a pretty short story as a matter of fact. After about 5 chapters I quickly realized that I could not keep this up for the long term. My lack of skill aside, I found the comic medium overall to be very... limiting. Webcomics tend to favor visuals over long lines of dialogue (If you think I'm wrong on that, go see what people are saying about the latest Hunter X Hunter manga chapters), and that didn't quite fit the vision I was going for. So ultimately, I decided to scrap the entire thing and go back to the drawing board(you can probably still find the webtoon out there somewhere, please don't look for it though, for your own sake and for my own).

            So, my webtoon side quest was a bust, what now? I was heavily inspired by Homestuck. Homestuck was able to have long dialogue sequences while also providing lots of visuals and interactivity to tell a unique story. I wanted to replicate that somehow, but I wasn't quite sure how. I was a little lost for a while until on day it was revealed to me in a dream where an angel from heaven descended upon me and said "you should make Cursed Gems a visual novel”. Ok no not really, I was just randomly in the shower one day and my inner voice was like, “hey dumbass, make it a visual novel”. And then I was like "That's right! Why don’t I make it a visual novel!" ...yeah, that was kinda the obvious choice looking back on it. It's kinda embarrasing that it took that long for me to come up with that. Regardless, now I could make both a game AND get to yap as much as I want! And now we’re here at the grand release of Cursed Gems Act 1. So, what's the plan from here? Theres going to be 5 different Acts. The first one is available now for free of course, and I will develop all the other acts and release them in a full paid game. I will consistently update you all on the development progress with this devlog so make sure to follow my Twitter and Bluesky for updates of new devlogs and my hilarious jokes.
